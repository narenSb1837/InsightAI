# üöÄ *Overview*  
This project is a chatbot designed to process and answer questions from uploaded PDF documents with minimal hallucinations. By leveraging *semantic chunking, **vector embeddings, and **LLM-based citation engines*, the chatbot ensures accurate responses with reliable citations.

## üõ†Ô∏è *Tech Stack*  

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Programming Language:* Python  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Vector Database:* Pinecone  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*LLM:* LLaMA-3  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Similarity Metric:* Cosine Similarity (Threshold: *80%*)

## üìë *Workflow*

### *1. PDF Upload and Preprocessing*  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The uploaded PDF is split into *semantic chunks* to maintain contextual integrity.  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Chunks are optimized to balance size and semantic meaning.

### *2. Embedding and Storage*  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Each chunk is converted into *embedding vectors* using the embedding model.  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†These embeddings are stored in *Pinecone* for efficient similarity searches.  

### *3. User Query*  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The user submits a query to the chatbot.  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The query is converted into an *embedding vector* using the same embedding model.  

### *4. Similarity Search*  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†A *cosine similarity* search is performed in Pinecone.  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The *top 5 most similar chunks* (with a similarity score ‚â• 80%) are retrieved and ranked in descending order of relevance.  

### *5. Query Processing with LLaMA-3*  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The top 5 chunks are passed to *LLaMA-3* for query resolution.  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†LLaMA-3 uses a *citation query engine* and a *reranking model* to:  
   - Provide a precise *answer*.  
   - Include *source citations* to ensure trustworthiness and reduce hallucinations.
